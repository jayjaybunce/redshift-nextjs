# The Tarragrue
[raidplan.io](https://raidplan.io/plan/W9OI4UciyNKbxkpS/edit)

<br/>

## Strategy

Around the Tarragrue's room there are adds and four large adds that drop an anima power. Every player will be able to collect four anima powers! These can be easily rerolled. 

A full list of these powers can be found on [wowheads writeup](https://ptr.wowhead.com/news/use-anima-powers-against-tarragrue-raid-encounter-in-sanctum-of-domination-321917)

<br/>

#### Necessary Anime Powers 
- [Everbeating Heart](https://ptr.wowhead.com/spell=347966) => Need at least one
- [Oddly Intangible Key](https://ptr.wowhead.com/spell=347967) => Good to have


#### Terrible Anima Powers
- [Erratic Howl](https://ptr.wowhead.com/spell=348027) => Please do not take


# Phase One


## [Chains of Eternity](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=347269)
=> The Tarragrue will mark a player and after 8 seconds throw a chain at them. We will have a player use [Everbeating Heart](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=338733) to counter this.

## [Hungering Mist](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=347671)
=> Fills most of the floor with black bad. There will be an area that's safe. When Hungering Mist is coming, be ready to move to the safe area.

## [Remnant of Forgotten Torments](https://ptr.wowhead.com/spell=352368)
=> Spawns a 'Remnant' zone or zones (not sure yet) that needs to be soaked

#### Three 'Remnants'
  - Grey zone ([Remnant: Upper Reaches' Might](https://ptr.wowhead.com/spell=352382)) - Soaking increases that players physical damage taken by 10%
  - Purple zone ([Mort'regar's Echoes](https://ptr.wowhead.com/spell=352389)) - Soaking increases that players magic damage taken by 10%
  - Orange zone ([Soulforge Heat](https://ptr.wowhead.com/spell=352398)) - Soaking applies a DoT on the player 
  

## [Predators Howl](https://ptr.wowhead.com/spell=347283) 
=> Several players will become affected by a purple circle - entering causes [Unshakeable Dread](https://ptr.wowhead.com/spell=347286). Pre-cast melee should spread. Players affected should spread from other players

# Phase Two

At 10% health, The Tarragrue will [enrage](https://ptr.wowhead.com/spell=347369) and will start literally clapping tanks. While the tanks are alive, they'll kite the boss around the room. 



# 	TLDR

Two phase fight

- P1 100%-10% Boss HP
- P2 GIGAENRAGE - Tanks will kite as long as possible

If you get marked with 'Chains of Eternity' simply find your way to the 'Moon'

- If you have the 'Everheating Heart' anima power call out that youre fine
- If you have an immunity, use it here
- If not, somebody will stand in the path of the chain and eat with with an immune

Soak all pools - 1 person per pool - Tanks should only soak purple pools

When the floor fills with black bad, find the safe spot

When the boss casts 'Predators Howl' spread out and watch for people with the purple fear circle around them.
