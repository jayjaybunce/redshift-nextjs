# The Tarragrue

## Strat

*Around the Tarragrue's room there are adds and four large adds that drop an anima power

One of these anima powers will help massively with the deadliest mechanic.

Plan: [raidplan.io](https://raidplan.io/plan/W9OI4UciyNKbxkpS/edit)

# Phase One

- The Tarragrue will cast 'Chains of Eternity' on a player which means death if it isn't intercepted by someone with the 'Everbeating Heart' power or an immunity.
- The Tarragrue will cast 'Hungering Mist' which essentially fills MOST of the floor with black bad and there will be an area that's safe. When Hungering Mist is coming, be ready to move to this safe area(s)
- The Tarragrue will cast 'Remnant of Forgotten Torments' which spawns a 'Remnant' zone or zones (not sure yet) that will need to be soaked:
  - Remnant: Upper Reaches' Might
    - **Ideally, tanks soak only purple ones and everyone else can soak the others**
    - Grey zone (Upper Reaches' Might) - Soaking increases that players physical damage taken by 10%
    - Purple zone (Mort'regar's Echoes) - Soaking increases that players magic damage taken by 10%
    - Orange zone - Soaking applies a DoT on the player 
- The Tarragrue will cast 'Predators Howl' 
  - Prior to this cast, everyone should spread (melee especially)
  - Avoid people with small purple circles around them, or you'll be feared for 8 seconds

# Phase Two

At 10% health, The Tarragrue will enrage and will start literally clapping tanks. While the tanks are alive, they'll kite the boss around the room. 



# 	TLDR

Two phase fight

- P1 100%-10% Boss HP
- P2 GIGAENRAGE - Tanks will kite as long as possible

If you get marked with 'Chains of Eternity' simply find your way to the 'Moon'

- If you have the 'Everheating Heart' anima power call out that youre fine
- If you have an immunity, use it here
- If not, somebody will stand in the path of the chain and eat with with an immune

Soak all pools - 1 person per pool - Tanks should only soak purple pools

When the floor fills with black bad, find the safe spot

When the boss casts 'Predators Howl' spread out and watch for people with the purple fear circle around them.
