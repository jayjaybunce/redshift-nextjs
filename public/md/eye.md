> ![p1plan.png](eye-assets/p1plan.png)

## [Dragging Chains](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=349979)
=> [Stygian Abductors](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=176521) will periodically mark a target and then deal damage and chain them. This effect should be soaked. When the chains come out after the damage, simply run away to break the chain. This will pull the [Stygian Abductor](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=176521) onto the platform. Slow cleave this add down.

# Phase Two

=> Occurs at 75%, 50% and 25% boss health. Two [Deathspeaker Eye's](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=179942) will spawn at the peak of both left and right platforms. The tanks will grab them and pull them to the very back of the room, keeping them 30 yards appart to prevent [Suffering](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=351826)

# 	TLDR

Two phase fight

- P1 Main Phase
- P2 75%, 50% and 25%

Everybody should soak [Dragging Chains](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=349979) and quickly bring the add down.

Move out of white swirlies, being hit by these will cause [Fractured Soul](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=350034).

The large white circle should be taken to the back of the room.

Players with [Spreading Misery](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=350816) should drop these on platform edges or the back wall.

This fight is pretty straight-forward but requires everybody to be mindful of their positioning.



Generall stay nearby but this fight is very heavy when it comes to movement.
